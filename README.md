## About
This is a prototype of an image classification model that detects human emotion. It is built using Python using Keras and Google's Tensorflow libraries. This model is currently deployed on a website. This model was made for an Artificial Intelligence Final Project for the 3rd Semester of BINUS University's Computer Science course.

## How to use
To use the model, the website currently deploying the model must be run on a local server using a service like XAMPP.
